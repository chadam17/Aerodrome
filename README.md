# Aerodrome

Manager of an aerodrome/airport fleet, including features and specs of the aircraft, learning courses, user profile and help sections. There are two main roles: admin and normal user.

When the app starts, you will see a welcome window where you can register a new user or log in with an existing account. You must create a new email which belongs to the airdrome, otherwise the system will ask you to enter a valid email. Once you get access, you will be redirected to the main section, the airplane database view. There you can check some data of each available plane. Only the administrator is allowed to modify the planes files, add new planes or delete them. 

The licenses view shows several training courses in order to obtain a flying license. You can enrol a course if you want, but if you already have the specific license, it will be shown at your profile and the system won't allow you to join the course. The administrator can edit the details of the courses. 

In the membership section, you will find your personal information, like your goals and achievements, among others. Please talk to the administrator if you need help to update your profile. 

If you are stuck at some point when using the app, you can go to the help section, which provides useful advice for novel users.

Note: you may need to run both Apache and MySQL services to start the app, I recommend you to install a free package like XAMPP or WAMP.
